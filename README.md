Better version of the List Game for Jake's playtests.

This will probably have no interest for you. But feel free to tinker with it if you want.

The List Game board is composed of 60 spaces split evenly (30/30) between two different categories
of like-sounding items.
The List Game is played by two teams who are trying to correctly pick board spaces for their category
without incorrectly claiming spaces that actually belong to the opposing category.

For example: Team A could have the category "Foreign Embassadors to the US" and Team B could have the
category "NPR Correspondents". The each reveal spaces in turn with each side getting a chance to claim
the space.
